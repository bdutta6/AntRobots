This serves as an e-introduction among all of us—Magnus and I are interested to see if his swarm work can be integrated with our ant robot work to learn if collisions among densely packed task oriented collectives of robots can be used to ensure good flow, etc. I suggest that all the students and postdocs cc’d on this email self-organize to trade info on what we (they) are doing and then in the coming weeks we can all meet to see if anything emerges...The new research direction on using ant-inspired collisions in swarm robot control/localization seems very interesting.

Grad Groups meeting today featured a woman from the library who overviewed the different resources available to graduate students. For research in engineering, she recommended compendex and inspec as good databases.

I was supposed to have a Skype call with JSP today to review the robotic ant systems, but he was not able to get online. Instead, we chatted on the phone, and I took down the following notes:

* Mechanically it is sort of sorted out
  *	Two of them are not working well (Echo and Charlie?)
* When you connect the batteries, you need to separate the batteries completely off of the wires
* Issues are not commented within the code

I also spent a good amount of time today studying the codebase and learning its architecture. I think I have a good understanding of it, and I love the thorough documentation. I am not sure I understand the Watch Dog Timers (WTD), and I haven’t found a satisfactory explanation of them online. I would love an explanation of them from JSP.

I continued reviewing the code, and Dr. Goldman showed me how to turn on the robots. There is a black switch on the side which turns it on and off, as well as a button on the main board which can be used to reset the robot.
All of the batteries were dead, so there are two things that I need to do to get started:

1. Learn how to charge the batteries
2. Make a power cable so that the robots can run off of a power supply (3.6V).
