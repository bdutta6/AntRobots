This serves as an e-introduction among all of us—Magnus and I are interested to see if his swarm work can be integrated with our ant robot work to learn if collisions among densely packed task oriented collectives of robots can be used to ensure good flow, etc. I suggest that all the students and postdocs cc’d on this email self-organize to trade info on what we (they) are doing and then in the coming weeks we can all meet to see if anything emerges,

The new research direction on using ant-inspired collisions in swarm robot control/localization seems very interesting.
